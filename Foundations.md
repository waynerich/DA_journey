<b>Data Analysis</b> is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful information which is then crafted into a story through visualization and reports for analysis to support decision-making<br>

<b>Core components of analytics:</b><br>
<b>Descriptive Analytics</b> help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. This technique is being used by evaluating data through a process known as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
&emsp;Application(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Developing Key Perfomance Indicators (KPIs) to track success or failure of key objectives<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Providing metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) to track performance<br>
&emsp;Example(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Generating reports to provide an overview of an organization's sales and financial data<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Looking at patterns of purchases from previous years to determine what products were popular<br>
<b>Diagnostic Analytics</b> help answer questions about why events happened<br>
&emsp;Application(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Supplementing descriptive analytics findings to discover the cause of events<br>
&emsp;Example(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Why were these specific products popular last year<br>
<b>Predictive Analytics</b> help answer questions about what will happen in the future / likely to happen<br>
&emsp;Application(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Using historical data to identify trends and determine if they're likely to recur<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Using statistical and machine learning techniques like Neural networks, Decision trees, and Regression to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns<br>
&emsp;Example(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Which products will be popular next year<br>
<b>Prescriptive Analytics</b> help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. This technique allows businesses to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty<br>
&emsp;Application(s):<br>
&emsp;&emsp;-Using machine learning to find patterns in large semantic models<br>
<b>Cognitive Analytics</b> attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences. It is like a self-learning feedback loop<br>
<br><br>
<b>Data Analyst</b><br>
&emsp;enables businesses to maximum the value of their data assets through visualization and reporting tools<br>
&emsp;helps organizations make sense of their data by uncovering valuable insights in order to make data-driven decisions and advocate for action<br>
<br>
<b>Data Analyst Responsibilities:</b><br>
&emsp;-Identifying and understanding the business problem by asking SMART questions<br>
&emsp;-Profiling, cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw data to uncover valuable insights<br>
&emsp;-Designing and building scalable and effective data models<br>
&emsp;-Enabling and implementing the advanced analytics capabilities into reports for analysis<br>
&emsp;-Managing Power BI assets like reports, dashboards, workspaces, semantic models for reporting<br>
&emsp;-Implementing and configuring proper security procedures of Power BI assets and data<br>
&emsp;-Collaborating with stakeholders to identify and gather the right data and reporting requirements<br>
&emsp;-Collaborating with data engineers to determine and locate appropriate data sources that meet stakholder requirements<br>
&emsp;-Collaborating with data engineers and database administrators to ensure proper access to the needed data sources<br>
&emsp;-Collaborating with data engineers to identify new process and improve existing processes for collecting data<br>
<br>
A <b>Data Analyst's goal</b> is to provide valuable insights through easy-to-comprehend visualizations and advocate for action to help organizations make informed business decisions<br>
<br>
<b>Data Analysts are needed</b> because organizations are having challenges with understanding and using data to positively effect change within the business which impacts their ability to act<br>
As an example, a retail business should use data such as tracking inventory, identifying purchasing habits, detecting user trends and patterns, recommending purchases, determining price optimizations, identifying and stopping fraud, which can positively impact their business<br>
<br>
<b>Roles in Data:</b><br>
<b>Business Analyst</b>, is closer to the business and is a specialist in interpreting the data that comes from the visualization<br>
<b>Data Analyst</b>, enables businesses to maximize the value of their data assets through visualization and reporting tools<br>
<b>Data Engineer</b>, provisions and sets up data platform technologies like relational databases, nonrelational databases, data stream, file stores that are on-premises and in the cloud. They manage and secure the flow of structured and unstructured data from multiple sources<br>
<b>Data Scientist</b>, performs advanced analytics to extract value from data. They determine the questions that need answers and will often devise a hypothesis or an experiment<br>
<b>Database Admistrator</b>, implements and manages the operational aspects of cloud-native and hybrid data platform solutions like Microsoft Azure data services and Microsoft SQL Server. They monitor and manage the overall health of a database and the hardware that it resides on<br>
<br>
<b>Data Analysis Process / Data Analyst Tasks:</b><br>
<b>Understand the business problem</b><br>
<b>Prepare</b><br>
Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming raw data into information that is in proper context and state for modeling and visualization<br>
&emsp;-Ensuring the integrity of the data, correcting wrong and inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one type to another, and making data more readable<br>
&emsp;-Understanding how to get and connect to the data and the performance implications to ensure that models and reports meet requirements and expectations<br>
&emsp;-Ensuring privacy and security by anonymizing data to avoid oversharing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when not needed<br>
<b>Model</b><br>
Data modeling is the process of determining how tables are related to each other by defining and creating relationships between tables, and optimizing and tuning semantic models<br>
&emsp;-Defining metrics and adding custom calculations to enrich the data<br>
&emsp;-Creating an effective semantic model to make reports mroe accurate for analysis, allow data to be explored faster and efficiently, decrease time for report writing process, and simplify future report maintenance<br>
<b>Visualize</b><br>
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information<br>
&emsp;-Using appropriate visualizations and interactions to provide an effective report that guides stakeholders through the content quickly and efficiently<br>
&emsp;-Designing and creating reports for accessibility<br>
&emsp;-Using the appropriate color schemes like complementary and for accessibility, fonts, sizing, and visuals to help with storytelling<br>
<b>Analyze</b><br>
Analysis is understanding and interpreting the information displayed on the report to find insights, identify patterns and trends, predict outcomes, and communicate those insights for organizations to make data-driven decisions<br>
<b>Manage</b><br>
&emsp;-Managing Power BI assets like reports, dashboards, workspaces, and semantic models to oversee the sharing and distribution of items between teams and individuals<br>
&emsp;-Ensuring the security of Power BI assets where only the right people have access<br>
&emsp;-Reducing data duplication to decrease data latency when resources are overused<br>
